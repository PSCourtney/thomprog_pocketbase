# Thomprog
This programme was created purely out of curiosity about how to create a frontend with [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/) and [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/). As I couldn't find anything on the net that met my requirements, I ended up programming something myself. The Thomprog is available to anyone who wants to continue using it. Documentation will follow here shortly. 
## Start Backend
  

Change to the pocketbase directory in the terminal and execute the following command:

    pocketbase.exe serve

This starts the backend

├─ REST API: http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/

└─ Admin UI: http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/

For more information, see Readme in Pocketbase folder.

In the thomprog directory run:

    dotnet run

This starts the frontend
